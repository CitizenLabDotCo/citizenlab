Benelux notification emails could be sent out by notifications@citizenlab.eu, US emails could be sent out by notifications@citizenlab.us etc., as long as those emails are owned by us. We can choose any email for "reply-to", so also email addresses we don't own. This means "reply-to" could potentially be configured to be an email address of the city, e.g. support@leuven.be. It is currently not possible to customize the reply-to (except for manual campaigns) and from fields for individual tenants.
