# We reinstall Que from scratch in all the tenant schemas (not the `public` schema). This
# is necessary because Que migrations did not play well with Apartment and did not run
# properly for all schemas. This created a bunch of inconsistencies across the different
# schemas. Currently, we have the following situation on production environments:
# - Que tables and other DB artifacts are simply missing altogether in some schemas.
# - Some schemas have version 4 of Que tables, while others have version 5.
# - The DB version of Que is sometimes incorrect (e.g., version is 4, but the DB objects
#   are actually from version 5).
# - Luckily, it seems that the migrations ran properly for the public schema.
#
# In practice, Que jobs are only stored in the `public` schema, so the most part these
# inconsistencies are inconsequential, but they are confusing and could lead to issues
# difficult to debug in the future.
#
# The problem when using Que jointly with Apartment is that Apartment breaks assumptions
# of the `Que.db_version` method which is used by Que to infer the current version of its
# DB artifacts. We patched it in order to take into account the fact that Apartment
# replicates the tables across the schemas. See {GemExtensions::Que::Migrations} for more
# information.
