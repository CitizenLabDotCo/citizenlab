# Frontend

This engine contains all functionality that's there only to support cl2-front operations. Anything in here is not directly related to the core business domain.

More specifically, this currently contains:
* The code that generates the json manifest
* A service that maps domain objects to cl2-front urls
* Endpoint to log user feedback about the front-end
