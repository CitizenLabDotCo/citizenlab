        # If the performance becomes an issue, +current_ref_distribution+ should be implemented as
        # an association on CustomField, either through a +belongs_to+ or an +has_one+.
        # * +belongs_to+ would probably be the best option, but it's more work to implement.
        #   (It would certainly require a join table and we would have to implement the lifecycle
        #   logic to keep that table up to date.)
        # * +has_one+ is possible also and cheaper to implement, but it may result in unexpected
        #   behavior when combined into more complex queries.
