        # If the performance becomes an issue, +current_ref_distribution+ method should
        # be rewritten as an association in the +CustomField+ *model*, either through a
        # +belongs_to+ or an +has_one+.
        # * +belongs_to+ would probably be the best option, but it's more work to
        #   implement. (It would certainly require a join table and we would have to
        #   implement the lifecycle logic to keep that table up to date.)
        # * +has_one+ is possible also and cheaper to implement, but it may result in
        #   unexpected behavior when combined into more complex queries.
