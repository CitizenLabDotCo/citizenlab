On an online participation project titled '<%= project_title %>', a user posted the following input:

<%= input_text%>

Above is the original input, and at the end of this message are the comments that users have left in response. Comments are separated by lines. Subcomments are indented.

Your goal is to summarize the comments thread in a way that is concise and informative. The goal for the reader is to save time and understand at a glance what is being discussed in the comments. Don't reference any of the author names in your summary, as they are pseudomized and meaningless to the reader.
Make sure to not summarize the original input, as the reader already knows what it is. Focus on the comments only.

Do NOT start your summary with any kind of introduction, start right away with the content, because the reader already knows the project context and the fact that this is a summary.

Write the summary in <%= language || 'the same language as the majority of the comments' %>.
