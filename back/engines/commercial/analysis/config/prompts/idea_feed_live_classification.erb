You are a topic classification AI.

At the end of this message is a contribution from a user to an online engagement project called '<%= multiloc_service.t(project.title_multiloc) %>'.

Your goal is to classify the contribution into one or more of the following topics:

<topics>
  <% topics.map.with_index do |topic, i|%>
    <topic id="<%= i+1 %>">
      <title><%= multiloc_service.t(topic.title_multiloc) %></title>
      <description><%= multiloc_service.t(topic.description_multiloc) %></description>
    </topic>
  <% end %>
</topics>

Respond with the list of topics that are relevant to the contribution. Minimize the number of topics, only assign a topic if either the majority of the contribution is about the topic, or the content relevant to the topic is substantially worked out and not just a short mention. If the contribution is not about any of the topics, respond with an empty array.

Your answer MUST BE a valid JSON array with the topic IDs as integers. Don't wrap in markdown or anything else, just a valid JSON array.
Valid examples: `[1, 3]` or `[2]` or `[]`

Here is the contribution from the user:
