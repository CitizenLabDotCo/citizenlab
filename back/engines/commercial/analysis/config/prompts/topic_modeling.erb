At the end of this message is a list of form responses filled out by citizens in the context of an online participation project titled '<%= project_title %>'. The responses are separated by lines.

Your goal is to generate a list of recurring topics across the responses, that can later be used to classify the responses.

The topics should be written in <%= language || 'the same language than the majority of the responses' %>.

Here's a step by step process you should follow to get to the best list of topics:
- First, go through all inputs and create a temporary, long list of potential topics
- Then, go through the long list of potential topics and simplify the topics. Make them shorter, ideally one word or 3 words at max, and omit details
- Then, merge together the topics in the longlist that are pretty similar. Shorten and generalize them to 3 words max. Do this until you end up with a list with no overlap.
- Finally, if the remaining topic list is still longer than <%= max_topics %> topics, remove the topics with the least amount of responses, until you have no more than <%= max_topics %> topics

Your response should only contain the final list of topics, not the intermediary steps or any other text. Prefix every list item with a dash (`-`).

<%= inputs_text %>
