At the end of this message is a list of form responses filled out by citizens in the context of an online participation project titled '<%= project_title %>'. The responses are separated by lines.

Your goal is to generate a list of recurring topics across the responses, that can later be used to classify the responses.

The topics should be written in the same language than the majority of the responses.

Here's a step by step process you should follow to get to the best list of topics:
- First, go through all inputs and create a temporary, long list of potential topics
- Then, go through the long list of potential topics and simplify the topics. Make them shorter, ideally one word or 3 words at max, and omit details
- Then, merge together the topics in the longlist that are pretty similar. Shorten and generalize them to 3 words max. Do this until you end up with a list with no overlap.
- Finally, if the remaining topic list is still longer than <%= max_topics %> topics, remove the topics with the least amount of responses, until you have no more than <%= max_topics %> topics

Your response should only contain the final list of topics, not the intermediary steps or any other text. Prefix every list item with a dash (`-`).

<%= inputs_texts %>
