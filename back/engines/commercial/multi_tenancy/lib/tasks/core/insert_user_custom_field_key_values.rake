# This is very similar to reformat_and_insert_user_custom_field_key_value_pairs.rake, with the differences that here we
# we don't reformat the values, and we read a specific key-value pair from the CSV custom_field_values hashes provided.
#
# This is designed to meet a very specific need. It is not meant to be a general purpose tool.
#
# This is to be used when, for example, we know that many users have 'lost' a specific key-value pair from their
# User.custom_field_values hash, and we want to re-insert that key-value pair into the hash.
# This might be facilitated by downloading a db dump from a production server, from before the data was 'lost',
# saving the user ids and custom_field_values hashes from that dump to a CSV file, and then running this rake task.
#
# Here's an example SQL query to get the CSV data from a production db dump:
#   SELECT id, custom_field_values FROM cqc_citizenlab_co.users
#   WHERE (custom_field_values ? 'who_you_are')
#   ORDER BY id ASC
#
# Important! This will overwrite any existing key-value with the same key. therefore, is is highly recommended to
# first make a backup to help deal with any issues that may arise from this.
#
# Example:
# Given a CSV file with the following headers: "id","custom_field_values":
#   "id","custom_field_values"
#   "6c43614c-025d-4d4b-8288-e8060be6b59f","{""gender_1"": ""male"", ""who_you_are"": [""7"", ""17""]}"
#   "6c43614c-025d-4d4b-8288-e8060be6b59f","{""who_you_are"": [""9""]}"
#
# $ rake cl2_back:insert_user_custom_field_key_value_pairs['/cf_values.csv','cqc.citizenlab.co','who_you_are']
#
# Note: the specified key must be present in the custom_field_values hash for each row of data in the CSV.
