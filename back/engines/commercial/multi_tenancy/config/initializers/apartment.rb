    # However, patching `Apartment::Adapters::PostgresqlAdapter` as suggested in the
    # comment did not work (the patched code was not executed during the migrations).
    # So we opted to patch `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter`
    # instead. Patching `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter` is not an
    # acceptable solution for Rails in general as it breaks the thread safety of
    # migrations that touches to multiple schemas. But in our case, all migrations are
    # run at the schema level and are replicated over all schemas. So that's fine. It's
    # not excluded that we can make this work by patching
    # `Apartment::Adapters::PostgresqlAdapter`, but this would require more research and
    # our time budget on this is limited.
