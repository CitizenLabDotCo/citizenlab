    # Not too many import tasks should be performed at the same time to avoid putting
    # too much pressure on Matomo. For this reason, we implemented a *simplistic
    # mechanism* relying on Postgres advisory locks to limit the number of concurrent
    # jobs (Que does not have that feature). However, Postgres advisory locks are binary
    # locks, so in order to allow more than one job to run at the same time, we use
    # multiple locks (`MAX_CONCURRENCY`). Each job is pseudo-randomly assigned to one of
    # these locks (based on the hash of its target site id). If it fails to acquire this
    # lock, the job is rescheduled (even if some other locks are available).
