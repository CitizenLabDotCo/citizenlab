-- This view has one record for each project with the last status of each project. 
-- Deleted projects are not included. 
-- The additional 'finished' column is computed based on whether the project has an
-- archived status or whether the last phase has been completed. It enables querying
-- of projects that are currently published (i.e. not finished via timeline) and 
-- projects that are finished.
