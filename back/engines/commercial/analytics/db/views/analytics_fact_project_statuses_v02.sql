-- This view lists the last statuses of each project.

-- All statuses, except 'finished', are sourced directly from the 'activities' table.
-- The view has one record for each project with one of those "regular" statuses. The
-- finished on the other hand is computed based on some application logic and does not
-- correspond to any status used in activities or admin publications. The finished
-- status comes in addition to the regular status. Thus, the view has two records for
-- finished projects.
-- The additional 'finished' column is added to enable querying of projects that
-- are currently published.
