    faq_title: Ceisteanna Coitianta
    faq_body: "<h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What is this platform for?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This platform is designed as a central hub to share information and get input and feedback. Participation projects that are currently active are shown on the homepage - each participation project may have a different mode of engagement, whether it's adding an idea, commenting on a proposal, voting on and prioritising projects, or taking a survey. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I participate? </h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always browse public projects, but you'll need to sign up in order to take an action. This helps to maintain a community feel and ensure the legitimacy of the input. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What information can people see about me?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Your name, photo and bio, if you've added one, are visible. You can always change these in your Settings.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why can't I post my input or submit a comment?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Posting, commenting and voting may be enabled only during certain times or phases of a project. In some instances, a project may only be open to contributions from a certain stakeholder group.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If posting is currently enabled for a project, you'll see a button that prompts you to submit a post. Alternatively, you can browse other active projects for additional engagement opportunities.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I edit or delete my input?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you've posted your input but want to make edits or delete it, you can find this option by clicking on the three small dots on the top right of the post. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What are the community guidelines and moderation policies?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Our community guidelines are here to help ensure that the platform is a safe space for everyone to participate. Please ensure your posts are free of:</p><ul>\n  <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Personal attacks, insults, abusive or discriminatory comments</li>\n  <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Offensive language including profanity</li>\n  <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Marketing or advertising material</li>\n  <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Personal information about other individuals</li>\n  <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Copyrighted material such as images</li>\n  </ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Any posts or comments that do not adhere to these guidelines may be edited or deleted, or in extreme instances, prevented from being posted. Please review our Terms &amp; Conditions for more information. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I report an offensive post?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Click on the three small dots on the top right corner of the post to report it. Please indicate the reason you are reporting the content - this will send a notification for the post to be reviewed.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why am I having difficulty signing up or logging in?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you're unable to sign up, it may be because you've already registered with the same email address or previously received an invitation to join the platform. If you see a message that your email address is taken by a pending invite, please check your email and follow the link in the invitation to register your account. If you can't find the invite, try looking in your spam box or request a new invitation. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I reset my password?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always request to reset your password from the log in page. If you reset your password, a link will be sent to your email address - follow the instructions to change your password. For security reasons, the link is valid for one hour. If the link has expired, you can simply click on 'Forgot password?' in the log in page again to generate a new reset link.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you didn't receive the email, check to make sure that it's not in your spam and that you're sending the link to the same email address that you signed up with.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What will you do with my data?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Review our privacy policy for more information on data collection and usage. In short, we will never use your data for advertising, marketing or other types of spam.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What emails will I receive?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You may receive emails related to your account and your activity on the platform, for instance, when someone responds to one of your posts. You can control which emails you receive in your Settings. There is a section called \"Notifications\" where you can turn email notifications on and off.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I delete my account?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In your Settings there is the option to delete your account. Input that you've posted will remain published, but your name will be removed from the post and replaced with 'unknown author.' If you'd like to delete all of your input, please do so before deleting your account. </p>"

    open_idea_project_description: >
      <p>Here, you can start your own idea if it doesn't fit within one of the existing projects.</p><p><strong>The objective?</strong> To get your idea on the political agenda.</p><p><strong>How?</strong> By gathering support, namely at least 100 votes in 3 months. You can do that by first making your idea 'attractive'. Write it in a clear and engaging way, add images, give strong arguments based on facts, add attachments with further details or background information, ... After you've done that, start sharing your idea on social media or through email. Invite people to join the discussion on your idea, or simply convince them to support it by voting in favour.</p><p><strong>About what?</strong> Your idea can be about a lot of things, as long as it is related to your city and its policy. It can be a problem you experience, a solution you envision or even a combination of both. It can be wild and on the long term, or very tangible and a quick win.</p><p><strong>And then? </strong>Did you reach 100 votes in 3 months? Congratulations! The city will now take your idea in consideration. If your idea is considered to be feasible and does not harm specific groups or individuals, you will get the chance to present your proposal during the council meeting. During that same meeting, the council members will give you direct feedback on what they will or won't do with your idea and why. If you don't gather 100 votes in 3 months, your proposal won't be considered.</p><p>We're curious to learn about your ideas!</p>
