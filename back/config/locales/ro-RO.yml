    faq_title: FAQ
    faq_body: "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>What is this platform for?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This platform is designed as a central hub to share information and get input and feedback. Participation projects that are currently active are shown on the homepage - each participation project may have a different mode of engagement, whether it’s adding an idea, commenting on a proposal, voting on and prioritising projects, or taking a survey. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>How do I participate? </strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always browse public projects, but you’ll need to sign up in order to take an action. This helps to maintain a community feel and ensure the legitimacy of the input. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>What information can people see about me?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Your name, photo and bio, if you’ve added one, are visible. You can always change these in your Settings.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Why can’t I post my input or submit a comment?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Posting, commenting and voting may be enabled only during certain times or phases of a project. In some instances, a project may only be open to contributions from a certain stakeholder group.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If posting is currently enabled for a project, you’ll see a button that prompts you to submit a post. Alternatively, you can browse other active projects for additional engagement opportunities.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>How do I edit or delete my input?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’ve posted your input but want to make edits or delete it, you can find this option by clicking on the three small dots on the top right of the post. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>What are the community guidelines and moderation policies?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Our community guidelines are here to help ensure that the platform is a safe space for everyone to participate. Please ensure your posts are free of:</p><ul>\n    <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Personal attacks, insults, abusive or discriminatory comments</li>\n    <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Offensive language including profanity</li>\n    <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Marketing or advertising material</li>\n    <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Personal information about other individuals</li>\n    <li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Copyrighted material such as images</li>\n    </ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Any posts or comments that do not adhere to these guidelines may be edited or deleted, or in extreme instances, prevented from being posted. Please review our Terms &amp; Conditions for more information. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>How do I report an offensive post?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Click on the three small dots on the top right corner of the post to report it. Please indicate the reason you are reporting the content - this will send a notification for the post to be reviewed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Why am I having difficulty signing up or logging in?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’re unable to sign up, it may be because you’ve already registered with the same email address or previously received an invitation to join the platform. If you see a message that your email address is taken by a pending invite, please check your email and follow the link in the invitation to register your account. If you can’t find the invite, try looking in your spam box or request a new invitation. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>How do I reset my password?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always request to reset your password from the log in page. If you reset your password, a link will be sent to your email address - follow the instructions to change your password. For security reasons, the link is valid for one hour. If the link has expired, you can simply click on ‘Forgot password?’ in the log in page again to generate a new reset link.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you didn’t receive the email, check to make sure that it’s not in your spam and that you’re sending the link to the same email address that you signed up with.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>What will you do with my data?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Review our privacy policy for more information on data collection and usage. In short, we will never use your data for advertising, marketing or other types of spam.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>What emails will I receive?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You may receive emails related to your account and your activity on the platform, for instance, when someone responds to one of your posts. You can control which emails you receive in your Settings. There is a section called “Notifications” where you can turn email notifications on and off.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>How do I delete my account?</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In your Settings there is the option to delete your account. Input that you’ve posted will remain published, but your name will be removed from the post and replaced with ‘unknown author.’ If you’d like to delete all of your input, please do so before deleting your account. </p>"

These proposals are preferably concrete ideas that are linked to local policy and arise from a need, desire or dream. It can be your own proposal or a collaborative one. Maybe you'd like to change or improve an existing situation or start a new project.</p> <p>The involvement of $|orgName| in the implementation of your proposal must be both necessary and possible. In an ideal scenario, you're also available for further reflection or cooperation, but that is not an obligation. "Reducing the speed limit on the highway to 80 km/h" is therefore not a strong proposal, while "Turning the main street into a pedestrian area" is. So bring on your proposals! If more information is needed, you'll receive an update or reaction.</p><h2>Why post a proposal on this platform?</h2> <p>This is the official participation platform of $|orgName|, which offers the following benefits:</p> <ul> <li>$|orgName| is officially involved as this platform's owner, and actively monitors what happens here. When you post a proposal, the person in charge automatically receives a message. You don't have to contact them to make sure your proposal is taken into account.</li> <li>This platform has been developed specifically for official participatory actions, like citizens' proposals. Every element, from the user experience to the step-by-step approach, is built precisely for this purpose. When using traditional social media, your proposal could disappear into the overload of stimuli, and an ordinary e-mail quickly disappears into a full inbox.</li> <li>Your fellow citizens are also present on this platform. They can support and refine your proposal. The more creative your proposal is and the more support it manages to gather, the more chance it will be implemented!</li> </ul> <h2>How do you get started?</h2> <p>First, check whether your proposal meets the following criteria:</p> <p>$|initiativesEligibilityCriteria|</p> <h2>What can you expect when your proposal reaches $|initiativesVotingThreshold| votes within $|initiativesDaysLimit| days?</h2> <p>$|initiativesThresholdReachedMessage|</p> <h2>What happens to the proposals that do not receive $|initiativesVotingThreshold| votes on time? </h2> <p>That happens, but don't worry. Your proposal will remain on the platform. The status of your proposal will automatically change to 'Expired'. As a result, voting will no longer be possible. If you wish, you can choose to delete your own proposal at any time.</p>

    open_idea_project_description: >
      <p> Aici, puteți elabora propria idee dacă nu se încadrează într-unul dintre proiectele existente. </p><p><strong> Obiectivul? </strong> Pentru a vă pune ideea pe agenda administrației locale. </p><p> <strong> Cum? </strong> Prin strângerea de sprijin, și anume, cel puțin 100 de voturi în 3 luni. Puteți face asta făcându-vă mai întâi ideea „atractivă”. Scrieți-o într-un mod clar și captivant, adăugați imagini, dați argumente puternice bazate pe fapte, adăugați atașamente cu detalii suplimentare, ... După ce ați făcut asta, începeți să împărtășiți ideea dvs. pe social media sau prin e-mail. Invitați oamenii să se alăture discuției cu privire la ideea dvs. sau convingeți-i pur și simplu să o susțină votând pentru ea.</p><p><strong> Despre ce? </strong> Ideea dvs. poate fi despre o mulțime de lucruri, atâta timp cât este legată de orașul dvs. și de politica sa. Poate fi o problemă pe care o întâlniți, o soluție pe care o preconizați sau chiar o combinație a celor două. Poate fi o idee îndrăzneață și de termen lung, sau foarte tangibilă și ușor de implementat. </p><p><strong> Iar apoi? </strong> Ați obținut 100 de voturi în 3 luni? Felicitări! Acum orașul vă va lua în considerare ideea. Dacă ideea dvs. este considerată a fi fezabilă și nu dăunează anumitor grupuri sau persoane, veți avea șansa să vă prezentați propunerea în timpul ședinței de consiliu local. În cadrul aceleiași ședințe, membrii consiliului vă vor oferi opinia lor în mod direct cu privire la ceea ce vor face sau nu vor face cu ideea dvs. precum și motivul. Dacă nu strângeți 100 de voturi în 3 luni, propunerea dvs. nu va fi luată în considerare. </p><p> Suntem curioși să aflăm ideile dvs.! </p>
