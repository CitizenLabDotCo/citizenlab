      <p>Овде можете покренути сопствену идеју ако се не уклапа у неки од постојећих пројеката.</p><p><strong>Циљ?</strong> Да би ваша идеја била на политичкој агенди.</p><p><strong>Како?</strong> Прикупљањем подршке, односно најмање 100 гласова за 3 месеца. То можете учинити тако што ћете своју идеју прво учинити „привлачном“. Напишите то на јасан и занимљив начин, додајте слике, дајте јаке аргументе засноване на чињеницама, додајте прилоге са додатним детаљима или позадинским информацијама,... Након што то урадите, почните да делите своју идеју на друштвеним мрежама или путем е-поште. Позовите људе да се придруже дискусији о вашој идеји или их једноставно убедите да је подрже гласањем за.</p><p><strong>О чему?</strong> Ваша идеја може да се односи на много ствари, све док је везана за ваш град и његову политику. То може бити проблем који имате, решење које замислите или чак комбинација обоје. Може бити дивља и дугорочна, или врло опипљива и брза победа.</p><p><strong>И онда? </strong>Да ли сте достигли 100 гласова за 3 месеца? Честитам! Град ће сада узети у обзир вашу идеју. Ако се ваша идеја сматра изводљивом и не штети одређеним групама или појединцима, имаћете прилику да изнесете свој предлог током седнице већа. Током истог састанка, чланови савета ће вам дати директну повратну информацију о томе шта ће или неће урадити са вашом идејом и зашто. Ако не прикупите 100 гласова за 3 месеца, ваш предлог неће бити разматран.</p><p>Радознали смо да сазнамо више о вашим идејама!</p>
