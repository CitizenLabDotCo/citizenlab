      <p>This online engagement platform aims to give as many people as possible the opportunity to think about the future of the city or institution that, together with Go Vocal, has set up this platform. These contributions are subject to a number of rules to keep the debate open and constructive. Below you can find the general conditions of our platform, as we are convinced that clear rules provide the best guarantee for a constructive online community.</p> <p>Because Go Vocal appreciates the feedback of the users of their platform, your ideas are welcomed to further improve the platform. You can forward your suggestions to support@govocal.com.</p> <h2>Who can register on the online engagement platform?</h2> <p>Anyone who wants to, can follow the debate online. Everyone can read the submitted ideas and reactions. If you want to participate in the debate yourself (sharing your own ideas, responding to other ideas or supporting existing contributions), you have to create an account. Only registered participants can make an active contribution to the online ideas platform.</p> <p>You can register via your e-mail address or create an account by simply linking it to your Facebook or Google profile.</p> <p>The creation of an account by a user does not give this user ownership over the account. Go Vocal reserves the right to refuse, suspend or delete accounts, for example if the user does not comply with the following rules or has previously been denied or removed from this user's account.</p> <p>Each account must comply with the following rules: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Every account is strictly personal</strong> <p> Each account must be unique and linked to a natural person. Every user has the right to create one account. If it is determined that one person has multiple accounts, Go Vocal reserves the right to delete all these accounts. Every user must have reached at least the age of 12 years. </p> </li> <li> <strong>An account cannot be transferred to another person</strong> <p> Since each account is strictly linked to one specific person, this account cannot be transferred to another person without the permission of Go Vocal. This transfer ban must be considered in the broadest sense. Go Vocal reserves the right to refuse or delete this account in case of infringements. </p> </li> <li> <strong>An account cannot be used for commercial purposes</strong> <p> The Go Vocal platform is intended to increase participation. An account can therefore only be used in that sense. Any use of the account for the sole purpose of enjoying a commercial advantage is prohibited. </p> </li> <li> <strong>The account information must always remain confidential</strong> <p> It is not allowed for another person than the actual person who created the account, to use this account. The person who creates the account must ensure that (s)he keeps the password and login details. We advise you to use a "strong" password (a password with a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters and numbers). Go Vocal can under no circumstances be held responsible for any loss or damage incurred to the account if the above conditions are not met by the user. Go Vocal cannot be held responsible for theft of your account, for example by 'phishing', either. Go Vocal will never ask its users for personal data such as a login or password via e-mail. If personal data is requested, the user will always be redirected to the platform of Go Vocal. </p> </li> </ul> <h2>Limitations to content and use of the platform</h2> <p>To ensure that the Go Vocal platform is working properly and that you can communicate and connect with others, there are some restrictions on the type of content that can be published via the platform:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Offensive behaviour</strong> <p> We firmly believe in freedom of speech. However, in order to ensure that the platform can be used in a constructive way by the users, with respect for different opinions and without people having to be afraid to express their opinions or convictions, we do not allow offensive behaviour that harasses, intimidates or uses fear to silence another user. </p> <p>Accounts and related accounts with which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked and / or permanently deleted.</p> <p> <ul> <li>Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not threaten or promote violence, including the promotion of terrorism.</li> <li>Harassment: You may not incite to or be involved in deliberately insulting or harassing others. Here are some factors that we can take into account when assessing abusive behaviour: whether the main purpose of the reported account is harassing or sending offensive messages to others; whether the reported behaviour is unidirectional or contains threats; whether the reported account encourages others to intimidate another account; and whether the reported account sends intimidating messages to an account from multiple accounts.</li> <li>Hatred: You may not promote violence against other people or directly attack or threaten them on the basis of race, ethnic background, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, philosophical affiliation, age, disability or illness. We also do not allow accounts whose main purpose is to incite others to do harm on the basis of these categories.</li> <li>Misuse of multiple accounts: Creating multiple accounts for overlapping use to avoid temporary or permanent suspension of an individual account is not allowed.</li> <li>Private data: you may not publish or post confidential data and private information of others without their express authorization and consent. These data include, for example, credit card numbers, address details, telephone numbers or data that constitute the personal privacy of a person.</li> <li>Impersonation: you may not be allowed to enter via the platform if someone else deceives, confuses or threatens in a manner that actually decks or threatens others.</li> </ul> </p> </li> <li> <strong>Spam</strong> <p>We strive at all times to protect the Go Vocal platform user from technical abuse and spam. Accounts in which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked or permanently deleted.</p> <ul> <li>Malware / phishing / viruses / worms / Trojans: You may not post malicious content or links to such content for the purpose of damaging or disrupting someone else's browsers or computers, or of violating someone's privacy.</li> <li>Spam: You cannot use the Go Vocal platform to spam people. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Infringement of applicable laws</h2> <p>The use of the account may not in any way infringe applicable laws. This includes infringements against privacy legislation, intellectual property rights, the criminal code,...</p> <p>The account may not be used in any way to promote illegal activities.</p> <h2>In case of breaches of the aforementioned rules </h2> <p>Go Vocal reserves the right, if it detects infringements on the aforementioned rules, to delete the relevant messages and even suspend or permanently delete user profiles. </p> <p>Go Vocal cannot be held liable in any way for messages posted by users or third parties, which violate the above rules. The web administrator will strictly supervise that these rules are not violated. If a user detects an infringement, one can always report this to the following e-mail address: support@govocal.com.</p> <p>It is possible that files can be downloaded via the platform, whether or not due to a user, or that users place harmful hyperlinks. Every download by a user or click on a hyperlink, placed by a user, is done at their own risk and any damage incurred is completely and solely the responsibility of this user.</p> <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2> <p>Go Vocal respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects that users of this platform also respect these rights. Go Vocal reserves the right to remove content that infringes intellectual property rights. Repeated infringements of intellectual property rights of any kind by a user will give rise to the suspension or removal of the account by Go Vocal.</p> <p>Infringements against intellectual property rights can be reported via the following e-mail address: support@govocal.com</p> <h2>Property rights Go Vocal</h2> <p>Go Vocal's platform is protected by intellectual property rights that relate to content, source code, database, etc. The use of this platform in no way means a transfer of these intellectual rights to the users of the platform. Every user must be aware of these rights and must act accordingly.</p> <p>It is thus forbidden to reproduce, distribute, modify or transmit the platform and its contents without permission.</p>

    faq_title: FAQ
    faq_body: "<h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What is this platform for?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This platform is designed as a central hub to share information and get input and feedback. Participation projects that are currently active are shown on the homepage - each participation project may have a different mode of engagement, whether it’s adding an idea, commenting on a proposal, voting on and prioritising projects, or taking a survey. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I participate? </h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always browse public projects, but you’ll need to sign up in order to take an action.

In some instances, a project may only be open to contributions from a certain stakeholder group.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If posting is currently enabled for a project, you’ll see a button that prompts you to submit a post. Alternatively, you can browse other active projects for additional engagement opportunities.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I edit or delete my input?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’ve posted your input but want to make edits or delete it, you can find this option by clicking on the three small dots on the top right of the post. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What are the community guidelines and moderation policies?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Our community guidelines are here to help ensure that the platform is a safe space for everyone to participate.

Please indicate the reason you are reporting the content - this will send a notification for the post to be reviewed.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why am I having difficulty signing up or logging in?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’re unable to sign up, it may be because you’ve already registered with the same email address or previously received an invitation to join the platform. If you see a message that your email address is taken by a pending invite, please check your email and follow the link in the invitation to register your account. If you can’t find the invite, try looking in your spam box or request a new invitation. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I reset my password?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always request to reset your password from the log in page. If you reset your password, a link will be sent to your email address - follow the instructions to change your password. For security reasons, the link is valid for one hour. If the link has expired, you can simply click on ‘Forgot password?’ in the log in page again to generate a new reset link.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you didn’t receive the email, check to make sure that it’s not in your spam and that you’re sending the link to the same email address that you signed up with.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What will you do with my data?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Review our privacy policy for more information on data collection and usage. In short, we will never use your data for advertising, marketing or other types of spam.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What emails will I receive?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You may receive emails related to your account and your activity on the platform, for instance, when someone responds to one of your posts. You can control which emails you receive in your Settings. There is a section called “Notifications” where you can turn email notifications on and off.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I delete my account?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In your Settings there is the option to delete your account. Input that you’ve posted will remain published, but your name will be removed from the post and replaced with ‘unknown author.’ If you’d like to delete all of your input, please do so before deleting your account. </p>"

    open_idea_project_description: >
      <p>Here, you can start your own idea if it doesn't fit within one of the existing projects.</p><p><strong>The objective?</strong> To get your idea on the political agenda.</p><p><strong>How?</strong> By gathering support, namely at least 100 votes in 3 months. You can do that by first making your idea 'attractive'. Write it in a clear and engaging way, add images, give strong arguments based on facts, add attachments with further details or background information, ... After you've done that, start sharing your idea on social media or through email. Invite people to join the discussion on your idea, or simply convince them to support it by voting in favour.</p><p><strong>About what?</strong> Your idea can be about a lot of things, as long as it is related to your city and its policy. It can be a problem you experience, a solution you envision or even a combination of both. It can be wild and on the long term, or very tangible and a quick win.</p><p><strong>And then? </strong>Did you reach 100 votes in 3 months? Congratulations! The city will now take your idea in consideration. If your idea is considered to be feasible and does not harm specific groups or individuals, you will get the chance to present your proposal during the council meeting. During that same meeting, the council members will give you direct feedback on what they will or won't do with your idea and why. If you don't gather 100 votes in 3 months, your proposal won't be considered.</p><p>We're curious to learn about your ideas!</p>
