    faq_title: FAQ
    faq_body: "<h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What is this platform for?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This platform is designed as a central hub to share information and get input and feedback. Participation projects that are currently active are shown on the homepage - each participation project may have a different mode of engagement, whether it’s adding an idea, commenting on a proposal, voting on and prioritising projects, or taking a survey. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I participate? </h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always browse public projects, but you’ll need to sign up in order to take an action. This helps to maintain a community feel and ensure the legitimacy of the input. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What information can people see about me?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Your name, photo and bio, if you’ve added one, are visible. You can always change these in your Settings.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why can’t I post my input or submit a comment?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Posting, commenting and voting may be enabled only during certain times or phases of a project. In some instances, a project may only be open to contributions from a certain stakeholder group.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If posting is currently enabled for a project, you’ll see a button that prompts you to submit a post. Alternatively, you can browse other active projects for additional engagement opportunities.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I edit or delete my input?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’ve posted your input but want to make edits or delete it, you can find this option by clicking on the three small dots on the top right of the post. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What are the community guidelines and moderation policies?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Our community guidelines are here to help ensure that the platform is a safe space for everyone to participate.

Please indicate the reason you are reporting the content - this will send a notification for the post to be reviewed.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why am I having difficulty signing up or logging in?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you’re unable to sign up, it may be because you’ve already registered with the same email address or previously received an invitation to join the platform. If you see a message that your email address is taken by a pending invite, please check your email and follow the link in the invitation to register your account. If you can’t find the invite, try looking in your spam box or request a new invitation. </p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I reset my password?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can always request to reset your password from the log in page.

If the link has expired, you can simply click on ‘Forgot password?’ in the log in page again to generate a new reset link.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you didn’t receive the email, check to make sure that it’s not in your spam and that you’re sending the link to the same email address that you signed up with.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What will you do with my data?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Review our privacy policy for more information on data collection and usage. In short, we will never use your data for advertising, marketing or other types of spam.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What emails will I receive?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You may receive emails related to your account and your activity on the platform, for instance, when someone responds to one of your posts. You can control which emails you receive in your Settings. There is a section called “Notifications” where you can turn email notifications on and off.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">How do I delete my account?</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In your Settings there is the option to delete your account. Input that you’ve posted will remain published, but your name will be removed from the post and replaced with ‘unknown author.’ If you’d like to delete all of your input, please do so before deleting your account. </p>"

    open_idea_project_description: >
      <p>Täällä voit aloittaa oman ideasi, jos se ei sovi yhteen olemassa olevista projekteista.</p><p><strong>Tavoite?</strong> Saadaksesi ideasi poliittiselle asialistalle.</p><p><strong>Miten?</strong> Keräämällä kannatusta, eli vähintään 100 ääntä 3 kuukaudessa. Voit tehdä sen tekemällä ideastasi ensin "houkuttelevan". Kirjoita se selkeästi ja mukaansatempaavalla tavalla, lisää kuvia, esitä vahvoja faktoihin perustuvia argumentteja, lisää liitteitä tarkempiin yksityiskohtiin tai taustatietoihin... Kun olet tehnyt sen, aloita ideasi jakaminen sosiaalisessa mediassa tai sähköpostitse. Kutsu ihmisiä mukaan keskusteluun ideastasi tai yksinkertaisesti vakuuta heidät tukemaan sitä äänestämällä sen puolesta.</p><p><strong>Mistä?</strong> Ideasi voi koskea monia asioita, kunhan se liittyy kaupunkiisi ja sen politiikkaan. Se voi olla kohtaamasi ongelma, kuvittelemasi ratkaisu tai jopa näiden yhdistelmä. Se voi olla villi ja pitkällä aikavälillä tai erittäin konkreettinen ja nopea voitto.</p><p><strong>Ja sitten? </strong>Saitko 100 ääntä 3 kuukaudessa? Onnittelut! Kaupunki ottaa nyt ideasi huomioon. Jos ideasi katsotaan toteuttamiskelpoiseksi eikä se vahingoita tiettyjä ryhmiä tai yksilöitä, sinulla on mahdollisuus esittää ehdotuksesi valtuuston kokouksessa. Saman kokouksen aikana valtuuston jäsenet antavat sinulle suoraa palautetta siitä, mitä he tekevät tai eivät tee ideasi kanssa ja miksi. Jos et kerää 100 ääntä 3 kuukaudessa, ehdotustasi ei oteta huomioon.</p><p>Olemme uteliaita kuulemaan ideoistasi!</p>
