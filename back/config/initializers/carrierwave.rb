  # Patch to solve Carrierwave issue with parsing URLs.
  #
  # Before removing, please first make sure the following
  # steps succeed:
  #   1. Download the file from
  #      https://cl2-seed-and-template-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/documents/vision_2028_de_metro_plan_estrategico.pdf
  #   2. Do not change the file name!
  #   3. Upload it as an attachment of an idea, on a real
  #      Citizenlab platform (not localhost).
  #   4. Get the corresponding file URL (e.g.
  #      my_idea_file.file_url). Do not use the Cloudinary
  #      URL instead (the issue is not reproducible with
  #      that URL)!
  #   5. Create a new idea file with this URL set with
  #      remote_file_url=.
  #   6. Use save! to save the file. You can remove this
  #      patch on success.
  #
  # Related issue: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/2415
  # However, they claim the issue is now solved on the
  # master branch, but this is not the case when executing
  # the steps mentioned above.
