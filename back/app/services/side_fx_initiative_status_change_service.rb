    # Behaviour we want when proposal review feature is on and initiative_status_change is to 'proposed':
    #   * Create an Initiative 'proposed' activity type, to trigger the InitiativePublished campaign.
    #   * Lock (prevent) editing of the initiative.
    # This works because, if the review feature is off, the associated initiative_status_change with code 'proposed'
    # is created at the model level when the initiative is published, and does not invoke this method.
