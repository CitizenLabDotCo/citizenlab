module Files
  # The Files::File model represents uploaded files in the system.
  #
  # = File categories
  #
  # This model implements a semantic typology for files through the +category+ attribute,
  # allowing users to categorize files based on their content type or purpose.
  #
  #   file = Files::File.new(..., category: :meeting)
  #   file.meeting?     # => true
  #   file.category     # => 'meeting'
  #
  # == Available Categories
  #
  # [+meeting+]
  #   The summary or minutes from an in-person meeting.
  #
  # [+interview+]
  #   The summary or notes from a 1-on-1 interview.
  #
  # [+strategic_plan+]
  #   An informational document that outlines how a project will achieve its goals
  #   and objectives. These files typically include project roadmaps, implementation
  #   strategies, resource allocation plans, timelines, and long-term vision statements.
  #
  # [+info_sheet+]
  #   An informational document to give more context about a topic, project, or process.
  #   These files serve as reference materials, fact sheets, or explanatory documents
  #   that provide background information and additional details.
  #
  # [+policy+]
  #   An official document with a policy proposal or established guidelines. These files
  #   contain formal policies, regulations, procedures, or proposed changes to existing
  #   governance structures and operational frameworks.
  #
  # [+report+]
  #   A general writeup to share results or summarize a process.
  #
  # [+other+]
  #   A catch-all category for files that don't fit into the specific categories above.
