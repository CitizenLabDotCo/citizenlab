CitizenLab is a **digital democracy platform** that facilitates community participation and co-creation. Participants can post ideas, contribute to discussion, or choose to vote and prioritize community projects. Whether it’s through a poll, a participatory budget, or idea collection, the CitizenLab platform offers multiple ways to make your community participate, and manage their inputs effectively.

## Demo platform

If you'd like to test out the functionalities before setting up your own instance, feel free to take a look at our **[demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/f1a80ddad6244222a9e976488f8ab19c)** or explore the **[demo platform](https://opensource.demo.citizenlab.co/)**, with all open-source functionalities enabled. Admin credentials are shown in the sign-up flow, if you'd like to get access to the back-office.

## Open-source model

CitizenLab adopts a so-called **[open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model)**, which means that there are two product editions available:

- CitizenLab Free Edition, including [all core functionalities](https://www.citizenlab.co/plans) described under Essential, freely available under the AGPLv3 license. This edition is designed for small organisations running their next engagement project.
- CitizenLab Commercial Edition, including [extra features](https://www.citizenlab.co/plans) described under Standard/Premium, available by the paid commercial license. This edition is your best option if you plan to run many engagement projects, in order to have access to more back-office functionalities and manage your platform efficiently.

The code repository is organised and configured to get you started on the Free Edition of the CitizenLab software. To use the Commercial Edition or get professional support, consider [becoming a CitizenLab client](https://www.citizenlab.co/plans).
