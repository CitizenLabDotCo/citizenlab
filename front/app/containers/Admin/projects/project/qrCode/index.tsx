  QR codes for easy / anonymous voting

  Presents a QR code to admins that they can print or make full screen - React lib generates this
  Scanning this code opens the site and registers you immediately with a unique code - no email or anything else needed
  Admin gets to define how many of these unique codes are available and generate more if needed
  Once users are 'logged_in' with QR code they can add an email - other actions will prompt for this data anyway
  QR codes can be disabled once the session or voting phase is over
  QR codes can be changed in case the code has got out when it shouldn't have done
  If users cannot use a QR code then admins can just give out the unique IDs for users to enter in a modal instead
  */

  /* 14th May */
  // TODO: Select a list of actions?
  // Does flexible reg allow you to upgrade your account with email etc
  // Add checkbox to voting, allow QR code for voting
  // New option qrcode / unique code
  // Add list of unique codes that can be allowed here - fdghtyur

  /* 2 FE URLs
     1. qrcode full version /projects/`projectId`/code/jshdjhsdjsjhsjdhjdhjshd
        - Calls the project/unique_code check endpoint which returns a code or 404
          - Should this 'reserve' the code for 5 mins - by adding a reserve date - so the next request does not return the same one before user is registered
          - Ignore the reserved validation if coming from a QR registration (using a param)
        - Then calls create user with unique_code in the same way as you could via the front-end
          - If unique_code is present then check it against the list of codes in the controller
         - When created redirect to the projects page
     2. version without the ID in it - /projects/`projectId`/code/ - that will display a modal box to enter your code

// If we want to configure where to redirect to then
// Could we change the invite model so that it can have emails or not associated with the codes
// Why does the invite model create a user - surely it should just store the emails in the invite and then create the user when needed
// We could then remove a whole load of guff out of the user model

  On QR endpoint
  1. Check if code matches what the endpoint returns in qr_code url
  if admin then the code gets returned in response
  if not then there is a true/false endpoint 200 / 404 for the code
  project/code/number - either returns 200 or 404
   */

  // Another idea: Can we auto generate our Types from the API documentation - or at least check they match?
  // To go alongside checking the logs against the documentation to see what is not used

  // On load of this page call the generate endpoint - which will which will return the project back

          Use carefully. Your QR code will open the following URL and log a user
          in for voting only without having to add any personal details. This is
          a unique long URL for this project. Click refresh if you want to
          change this URL and the associated QR code. The QR code will register
          a user against one of the unique codes below. You can generate more
          codes if needed. If you want to Associate these codes with a smart
          group, so you can tell what happened in each session. Or associate
          with an event? Codes should be associated with a project.
