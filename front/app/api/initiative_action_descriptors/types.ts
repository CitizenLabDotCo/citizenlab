// people to be able to reaction on comments. This is instead derived from 'commenting_initiative'.
// Why is it an action descriptor then, and why don't we just use 'commenting_initiative'?
// Because of legacy reasons. Should be fixed in the future.
// For now, just know that 'comment_reacting_initiative' is just an action descriptor,
// but not an action (so e.g. it can't be used in the authentication_requirements API).
