Ask the responsible within your municipality or organisation to give you the needed permission rights to become a project moderator.

This will also allow you to invite others to the platform, enabling them to post ideas within your project, reaction or comment.</p>\n<h2>Can I participate as an association/organisation/committee? </h2>\n<p>Yes, that\'s possible. Given that only your first and last name are visible to others on the platform, you can simply use your organisation\'s name while setting up your profile.</p>\n<h2>Why would I use this platform and not create a website myself?</h2>\n<p>A team of dedicated developers and specialists in online participation (<a href="https://www.citizenlab.co/en" target="_blank">CitizenLab,</a> commissioned by your municipality or organisation) is improving and updating this platform on a daily basis.
