The publication of the CitizenLab Software in Source Code is solely made for informational purposes.

1.2 Restrictions. Nothing in Section 1.1 grants You the right to (i) use the CitizenLab Software Source Code other than in accordance with Section 1.1 above, (ii) use a Derivative Work of the CitizenLab Software outside of a Non-production Environment, in any production capacity, on a temporary or permanent basis, or (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise make available the CitizenLab Software Source Code, in whole or in part, to any third party or (iv) use CitizenLab Software Source Code (in Object Code or otherwise) for providing any software-as-a-service, service bureau services or as part of an application services provider (ASP) or other service offering (collectively, “SaaS Offering”); (v) circumvent the limitations on use of CitizenLab Software provided to You that are imposed or preserved by any Functional Restriction, or (vi) alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the CitizenLab Software.

1.3 Third Party Open Source Software. The CitizenLab Software may contain or be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and other open source software (collectively, "Open Source Software"), which Open Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website designated by CitizenLab. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). To the extent any condition of this Agreement conflicts with any license to the Open Source Software, the Open Source Software license will govern with respect to such Open Source Software only. CitizenLab may also separately provide you with certain open source software that is licensed by CitizenLab. Your use of such CitizenLab open source software will not be governed by this Agreement, but by the applicable open source license terms.

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CITIZENLAB AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE CITIZENLAB SOFTWARE, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING. FURTHER, CITIZENLAB DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS OF USE OR THAT THE CITIZENLAB SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE USE OF THE CITIZENLAB SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

3.2 Limitation of Liability.

4. MISCELLANEOUS

This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified by CitizenLab from time to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the "Posted Date" set forth at the top of the modified Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Belgian law. This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Brussels, except where mandatory law provides for the courts at another location in Belgium to have jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens, or any similar claim or defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 2 may cause irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and therefore CitizenLab shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of CitizenLab, which may be withheld or granted by CitizenLab in its sole and absolute discretion. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to CitizenLab may also be sent to legal@citizenlab.co.
